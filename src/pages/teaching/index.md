**Description**. The field of Cognitive Psychology includes the psychology of human perception, attention, memory, language, thinking (including problem solving and reasoning), and consciousness. The course will emphasize not only the content represented by these topics, but also the processes by which researchers develop theories and collect evidence.

A central theme of the course is how findings from cognitive psychology can improve the studying and learning habits underlying academic success. Students will be encouraged to develop skills to improve their learning strategies in this class and in other classes.

The fields of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence share an intellectual history, and there is much to be gained by considering how the two disciplines can inform each other, especially in light of the current revolution in generative artificial intelligence. AI also affords new tools that can be used to enhance learning. Class activities will include the use of U of M’s instance of GPT4-Turbo and Maizey AI platforms. No prior experience with AI is necessary.

Class activities will include the use of AI models available for free at U of M. In addition, depending on the technology available this spring, class activities may require a subscription to other AI models (approximately $40 for the term).

This course will be online and synchronous, delivered via Zoom. It will be interactive, so students should have a device with a camera, microphone, and keyboard. 

Learning will be assessed via objective examinations, small-group oral presentations, and other assignments.

There is no textbook. Readings will be posted on the Canvas site and drawn from other online sources.

#### Cognitive Science of Academic Success
*First-year seminar: Enrollment: 18-20*
<br> Best practices for success in college, based on cognitive science and a thoughtful analysis of the state of higher education at a large public university. Cognitive science research on human learning and memory has discovered a great deal about how people can study and learn effectively. One goal of the class is to enable students to apply this research to their own course taking. Another goal is to learn and apply the science behind other important facets of success, such as managing time, avoiding technological distractions, and developing a sense of personal values and purpose.

#### Mind, Brain, and Evil
*First-year seminar: Enrollment: 18-20:* Why do people hurt each other?  Violent and cruel behavior is everywhere, yet there is still much to be learned about the psychological and brain processes that contribute to such behavior.  How does the human mind and brain cause evil?  In this course we shall examine some of the scientific findings about violence and some of the relevant theories from psychology and neuroscience. We’ll consider how biological and psychological factors interact with an individual's social context and environment to produce violence. Our discussions will include psychological, psychiatric, neurological, and evolutionary perspectives on a wide range of violent behavior, ranging from individual acts of aggression and criminal behavior to war and genocide.  The goal is not only to learn about violence and evil, but also to consider, compare, and possibly change our own personal perspectives on the problem.

#### Consciousness
*First-year seminar: Enrollment: 18-20*:
Consciousness, our internal experience of ourselves and the world, is the greatest challenge still facing science. It's such a hard problem that some believe it's beyond the capability of scientific inquiry. In this course we shall examine some of the best thinking about consciousness and some of the relevant phenomena that shed light on it.  What is consciousness?  Can brain scans and observations of brain-injured patients tell us where in the brain consciousness is located?  Can computers be conscious?  What about animals?  Is your experience of the color green the same as mine, or does your green look to you more like my red looks to me? What do dreams mean?  How do you know you're not dreaming right now?  What happens to consciousness in hypnosis and meditation?  Do psychic abilities really exist?  What happens in near death experiences?  What can religious experiences and beliefs tell us about consciousness?​
